This project is dedicated to analyzing human resource data for a company. The initial phase focuses on data cleaning using Python.

Once the data is clean , the next phase involves  analysis using Pandas.

Furthermore, the project incorporates the visualization aspect using [Power Bi](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/power-bi/). 

### Data description

termdat :  The termination date in the dataset signifies various employment outcomes, including termination by the employer, voluntary resignation by the employee, or dismissal. When the termination date is represented as NaT (Not a Time), it indicates that the employee is currently still employed and has not yet undergone any termination process.

### Tools

1. Python : Data Cleaning 
2. Data Cleaning : [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#grouping)
3. Power-bi : Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning

This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates,removing inutil data,Formatting date ...

### Data Analysis

The Analysis will be done Using Pandas By answering variouse questions. Various statistical techniques and methodologies are applied to uncover patterns, trends.

#### Questions Are 

    What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
    What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
    What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
    How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
    What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
    How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
    What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
    Which department has the highest turnover rate?
    What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
    How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
    What is the tenure distribution for each department?

### Dashboard analysis with Powerbi

### Summary
This analysis provides valuable insights into workforce demographics, employee performance, retention rates, and other key HR metrics.
